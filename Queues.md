# What?

A queue is a collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue.

A queue implements FIFO (first-in first-out) ordering.

# Why?

Use a queue when you want to get things out in the order that you put them in.

O(1) time.

# When?

Queues are often used is in breadth-first search or in implementing a cache.

A queue can also be implemented with a linked list. In fact, they are essentially the same thing, as long as items are added and removed from opposite sides.

# What?

Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms

# Why?

Big O notation allows you to analyze algorithms in terms of overall efficiency and scaleability

O(1) - Constant

O(N) - Linear

O(N^2) - Quadratic

# When?

Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Actually Big O notation is special symbol that tells you how fast an algorithm is.

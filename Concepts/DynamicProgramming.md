# What?

Dynamic programming is when you use past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier. (e.g.fibonacci sequence)

# Why?

Because we are working bottom-up, we already have solutions to the sub-problems when it comes time to use them, by memoizing them.

# When?

If you solution is based on optimal substructure and overlapping sub problem then in that case using the earlier calculated value will be useful so you do not have to recompute it. It is bottom up approach.

# What?

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.

# Why?

OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs. It is good for defining abstract data types. Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface. It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.

# When?

Use OOP when you need to reuse existing code and make it work transparently with new code you add, while still hiding all the underlying complexity.
